Max/Msp patches for snowboard

Hey there

To use this patches you need to do the following:

1. Upload the correct Arduino file to the SnowBoard.(You will need to have the  Snowboard library for Arduino).
2. Open to matching max patch to your sensor(1007/1610).

*If you want to edit the patch you will need to download and install cv.jit by Jean-Marc Pelletier.(The blob recognition is based on this library)
