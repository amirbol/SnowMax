Max/Msp patches for snowboard

Hey there

To use this patches you need to do the following:

1. Upload the Arduino file to the SnowBoard.(You will need to have the  Snowboard library for Arduino).
2. Open the mxf file with Max/Msp(must be a 32bit version!!)

*If you want to edit the patch you will need to download and install cv.jit by Jean-Marc Pelletier.(The blob recognition is based on this library), you can find the files in source folder.

If you have any suggestion or problems please send me email:

Been checked only on Max 6.1.7 and Max 7.0(32bit) Os x 10.8.5 and windows 7
